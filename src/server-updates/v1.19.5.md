# Updates from January 19/20, 2024

A role distributor has now been implemented that divides the individual roles into categories.
In particular, the role of "Contributor" can now be assigned to anyone who has contributed to the GitHub project.
In addition, certain errors such as "DiscordAPIError[50007]: Cannot send messages to this user" have been successfully resolved.
These updates significantly improve the overall functionality and usability of the platform.

In addition, pronouns can now be specified under “Select Channels Roles”.
This new feature allows users to choose their preferred pronouns and display them in the appropriate channels.
This customization provides a personalized and inclusive experience as users can better represent their identity on the platform.
