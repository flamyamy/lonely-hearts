# Updates from January 19, 2024 

In the latest updates, the #welcome team list has been fixed due to a message error that prevented the team list from updating.

In addition, the permanent canals were abolished as they were deemed unnecessary. This decision was made to optimize the channel structure and focus on efficient communication. The removal of permanent channels is intended to improve workflows and increase user-friendliness within the platform.

We hope that these changes contribute to a smoother and more effective use of the platform and are happy to answer any questions you may have.
